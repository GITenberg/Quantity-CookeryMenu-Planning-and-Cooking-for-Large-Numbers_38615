<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book has been written in response to the many requests for
practical help in the planning of menus and for the recipes in use in
the cafeteria under the management of the authors.</p>

<p>This book is designed primarily to assist the managers of food
departments in institutions. However, it is hoped that the chapters on
menu planning, the recipes, and the list of weights and their
approximate measures may prove useful as a text for those teachers of
institution management who have the problem of teaching large quantity
cookery and menu planning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE PLANNING OF MENUS FOR LARGE NUMBERS</h3>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>
Well-balanced and appropriate menus are absolutely necessary to the
success of any establishment serving food. Given the best of raw
materials and the most competent cooks, the institutional manager will
fail to please his patrons if his menus show lack of careful planning.
The truth of this assertion is verified by the analysis of many
failures.</p>

<p> On the other hand successful menu planning is not especially difficult.
Like any other art it requires careful study and observance of a few
simple rules.</p>

<p>Of course, it is impossible to formulate one set of rules that will
apply to all situations. Each manager must make his own rules based on
the conditions he has to meet. There are, however, certain basic
principles to be recognized and followed. If the ensuing chapters
succeed in explaining these principles and in emphasizing their
importance, the authors' purpose will have been served.</p>

<p>In planning menus for an institution the manager must:</p>

<p>Keep in mind the nature of the institution; its purpose; the character
of its patronage.</p>

<p>Follow certain dietetic principles.</p>

<p>Maintain constant variety in the food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Keep menus appropriate to the temperature; the weather; the season;
occasional holidays.</p>

<p>Recognize the limitations imposed by equipment; amount and kind of help;
range of cost permitted; left-over foods to be used; form of service.</p>

<p>The first point to consider in planning a menu is the type of
institution to be served. For reasons that are obvious, the purpose of
the high school cafeteria is very different from that of the
metropolitan hotel, while neither of these has the same object as the
municipal tuberculosis sanitarium.</p>

<p>The age, sex, nationality, economic condition and occupation of the
patrons must be kept in mind. The adult demands a freedom of choice
which may be denied children. For this reason the content of the grade
school lunch may be fixed in an arbitrary way, while this will not do
when one is dealing with adults of any class. For instance, grade school
children are satisfied with the morning bowl of bread and milk and the
noon lunch of bread and soup. Adults, even in a charitable home, would
undoubtedly complain of the simplicity of such meals. The high school
lunchroom may eliminate coffee from its menu and have frequent "pieless"
days. Any such attempts to regulate the diet of adults, except for
patriotic reasons such as were the incentive to denial during the war,
are highly inadvisable.</p>

<p>As far as the food elements are concerned, the same kinds of food may be
served to boys and girls or to men and women. But, practically, they
will not eat the same foods with equal satisfaction, and this should
influence the planning of menus in different institutions.</p>

<p>School lunch managers and social service workers have found that in
order to accomplish their aims they have to recognize racial food
tastes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The economic condition of the group to be served may limit variety in
the menu, on the one hand, or may permit of maximum variety on the
other. The eight-page menu of the fashionable tea room as definitely
reflects the ability of the patrons to pay as does the simple meal of
three or four dishes served the immigrants at Ellis Island.</p>

<p>The occupation of the patrons, whether active or sedentary, determines
to a large extent the kind of food served to them, from the dietetic
standpoint and from the commercial standpoint as well. The lumberjacks
of the north woods require a diet very different in quality and quantity
from that of the telephone operators in a city exchange.</p>

<p>In institutions serving set menus, with little or no choice, special
attention should be given to dietetic principles. Examples of such
institutions are college dining halls or dormitories, hospitals,
benevolent "homes," boarding houses, fraternities and clubs.</p>

<p>For those who have had little or no training in dietetics and who yet
have the responsibility of planning menus, it may be said that if ample
variety is provided, with emphasis on fruits and vegetables, the
dietetic requirements will probably be met.</p>

<p>The sequence of foods in the menu is important. Where several courses
are to be served, and it is the aim of those planning the menu to keep
the appetite stimulated, acids, meat extractives and warm foods should
be served first. Cloying foods such as sweets, very cold foods and foods
which are satisfying tend to depress the appetite and hence have no
place in the first course of a meal, except for luncheon where the menu
may be very simple. In institutions which have fixed menus, it is
especially desirable that the meal, no matter how simple, be so planned
that it may be served in courses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Children especially are likely to
hurry through their meals, and the serving of food in courses prevents
too rapid eating. It is true, of course, that extra service requires
more labor, and so may not prove possible, even though desirable.</p>

<p>The responsibility for maintaining a constant variety in food calls for
the continued exercise of initiative, the determination to avoid
monotonous repetition, a mind open to new foods and new methods of
preparation and systematic marketing trips in order to keep in touch
with seasonal changes. Perhaps the most frequent criticism of
institutions is on the lack of variety in meals. Hotels, clubs and tea
rooms can draw trade by serving out-of-season foods when they first
appear in the market. Institutions whose purchases are limited by a
budget should make the most of seasonal foods when the market is at its
height and the food is cheapest. Such institutions should avoid serving
foods that are not actually in season. Serving berries or melons before
the height of the season dulls the appetite of the patron for these
foods so that by the time they have become economical to serve he has
tired of them.</p>

<p>Variety should be introduced not only in the kinds of food but in the
preparation, garnish and service. Even in charitable homes and other
institutions where the aim is to serve at a minimum cost, the menus can
be made attractive through variety in preparation. Corn meal and cottage
cheese, two of the least expensive foods we have, can be utilized in a
wide variety of ways. There should be no hesitation about serving new
dishes, for maximum variety is essential to a happy patronage whether in
the tea room or the benevolent institution. The point to be kept in
mind, where the guest has the privilege of selection, is that all the
variety should not come within the day or meal but within the week or
month.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Surprise always helps to induce appetite and this fact is as
applicable to the menu in the children's home as to that of the tea
room.</p>

<p>It is good business practice as well as good dietetic practice to plan
meals according to the weather and the time of year. Hot, heavy foods
sell best in cold weather. Cool, crisp, fresh foods sell best on the
hottest days. The public is very susceptible to weather conditions.
Holidays give a popularity to certain foods which they enjoy at no other
time of the year. It is good business to make the most of these foods by
serving them on appropriate days.</p>

<p>There are definite relations between the menu and the equipment
available for its execution. For instance, a menu which calls for oven
cooking to the exclusion of the use of the top of the stove or
supplementary steamers will be impossible to carry out. The menu should
be planned in order that the cooking may be divided between all the
available equipment, such as ovens, steamers and top space on stoves. In
the kitchen, as in the industrial plant, it is good management to give
space only to efficient equipment and to use that equipment to its
maximum capacity.</p>

<p>Again, incomplete equipment may have to be considered in planning the
menu. If there is no power machinery the amount of hand work or heavy
physical preparation called for may have to be cut down in accordance
with the equipment at hand. In serving large numbers power machinery
will often pay for itself in a few months through the saving in labor.
It will not only do the work better and more humanely but will allow a
much greater variety of food. In the matter of equipment the institution
must get away from the idea that it is a large home, with working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
conditions as they have been in the average home. It should consider
itself an industrial plant where one of the aims is maximum production
with minimum labor; and it should realize that proper equipment and
proper working conditions are necessary in the accomplishment of this
aim. Even though the labor supply may be adequate, efficient planning of
menus demands that there be an adjustment between those foods requiring
much labor and those requiring little, so that proper balance may be
maintained.</p>

<p>In discussing the limitations in menu making the element of cost has
come up again and again. It becomes a definite restriction in
institutions that work on a budget, or where the group to be served
demands good wholesome food at the lowest price. As examples of such
institutions there are the factory cafeteria, the school lunch and the
college cafeteria.</p>

<p>Though menus must be made out in advance of the day when they are to be
used, they should be sufficiently elastic to allow for proper
utilization of left-overs. Using left-overs may mean very little change
and substitution, or may require complete revision of the day's meals.
Left-overs must be used, for it is only by constant care that the food
cost can be kept down to a minimum. That this is true of all
institutions, whether great or small, is shown by the extreme care
exercised in the largest hotels to the end that no food shall be wasted.
Where there is family service, rather than plate service from the
kitchen, there will probably be a large amount of left-over food. It
requires a good deal of ingenuity to use these left-overs in some other
form so as to maintain variety and that element of surprise which is so
essential. In the cafeteria or other institution using <i>à la carte</i>
service the left-over problem is not so serious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
 It is very nicely taken
care of in tea rooms and hotels which serve a club luncheon, the menu
for which may be chiefly made up from the left-overs.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the form of service may influence the kind and extent
of the menu. That is, the cafeteria can serve a large variety of dishes
because the patrons wait on themselves. A similar choice or variety is
impracticable where there is table service, except in hotels,
restaurants and tea rooms where cost is not so great a factor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>STANDARDS FOR JUDGING MEALS</h3>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Provided the principles of good nutrition have not been violated, the
main basis for judging any meal is palatability. Palatability depends
upon appearance and quality. Appearance in turn depends upon quantity,
color, form and service upon the plate. Quality is determined by odor,
flavor, temperature, texture and consistency. Reduced to outline form,
the elements of palatability are:</p>

<table summary="Standards for judging meals">

<tr>

<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Commercially and aesthetically it is unwise to make servings too large.
Every one has had the experience of being served with more food than can
be eaten with relish and without waste. The effect is to surfeit the
appetite and to limit the variety which a patron may have, unless he is
able financially to order the variety; in which case he is obliged to
leave some food uneaten. In any institution which serves <i>à la carte</i>,
it is better to adjust portions and prices to the end that the patron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
may have some variety in his meal without prohibitive expense.</p>

<p>Color is important in inducing appetite. The cafeteria counter
displaying a buff-colored pie, snow pudding, rice custard and yellow
cake does not tempt patrons to buy. A basket of fruit, a bright-colored
gelatin dessert or attractive garnishes may transform a drab meal into a
most interesting one. Particularly in all kinds of plate service,
attention must be paid to color, for while clashing color combinations
must be avoided, some color must be used to give the food an appetizing
appearance. A great deal of our food is very neutral in color and admits
of a liberal use of garnishes of one kind or another.</p>

<p>As a rule articles of food served together should be of diverse shapes.
One may enjoy a croquette, a stuffed baked potato, peas in timbales and
a roll in the same meal, but it is usually unwise to serve them on the
same plate.</p>

<p>The necessity for neatness and orderly arrangement of servings is
obvious. At large parties where there is plate service it is wise to
make up a sample plate before the time of serving in order to determine
the best arrangement of food and in order actually to show those who are
to dish up the food how each plate must look when it is placed before
the guest. One who is inexperienced in planning menus, especially for
parties, should accustom himself to visualizing the meal as it will
appear when written upon the menu card and as it will appear upon the
plate. A menu which has seemed very good when planned will often be
unsatisfactory when actually served because some of the above points
have been overlooked.</p>

<p>Odor and temperature are important factors in quality. It would seem
superfluous to say that hot things must be served hot and cold things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
must be served cold, yet in serving large numbers the strict observance
of these rules is one of the difficult problems to be solved. <i>It can be
solved, however</i>, with efficient equipment properly arranged, a
carefully thought out organization of service and unceasing care.</p>

<p>Repetition of texture and consistency should also be avoided. That is to
say, there should be the maximum variety in preparation of food in order
that no meal shall contain two or more creamed dishes, fried foods,
foods with custard basis or foods with bread foundation.</p>

<p>If a score card were made out for judging a meal, flavor would perhaps
be given the most importance. Here again care must be taken to avoid
duplicating flavors. Too many strong flavors or too many bland flavors
are undesirable. While strong flavors stimulate the appetite it is
unwise to employ them continually, especially where the same group of
people is being served day after day. A more blandly flavored diet is
likely to be less palling and more constantly inviting.</p>

<p>In serving the public, whether it be in the hospital, the college
dormitory or the commercial restaurant, the aim should always be to have
the food better than that to which the patrons are accustomed.</p>

<p>In almost any kind of food work, and especially in institutional food
work, visiting trips to the best hotels, tea rooms, inns, cafeterias and
restaurants are invaluable, since they impart a knowledge of the way
things are done, which in turn creates a confidence and assurance that
nothing else can give.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>TYPES OF MENUS</h3>


<h4>CAFETERIA MENUS</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Though it may be necessary to offer slightly more choice in foods in the
commercial cafeteria, some cafeterias offer such a wide variety of
choice that the patron is confused and has difficulty in choosing his
meal. Furthermore too much variety makes for sameness from day to day.
In all cafeterias where the same group is served each day, and where
there is little or no competition, a simpler menu may be used. The
following menu outline is suggested for use in the average cafeteria.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h5>A Standard Form for Cafeteria Menu</h5>

<p>
    1 soup<br />
    2 meats<br />
    (1 meat substitute)<br />
    1 kind of potatoes<br />
    2-3 vegetables<br />
    1-2 hot breads<br />
    1-2 sandwiches<br />

<h5>Thirty Days' Menus for a Cafeteria</h5>

<p>The careful manager spends a great deal of time in menu planning. If
some systematic method of menu making can be adopted and used with a
mind constantly alert to seasonal changes in foods, new and attractive
dishes and variety in serving, the plan may result in saving much of
this time.</p>

<p>A set of menus for thirty days has been worked out, with the idea that
they may be repeated at the end of that time without too monotonous
repetition. No Sunday meals are included since the majority of
cafeterias are closed on that day. The Friday menus occur on the fifth
day and every sixth day thereafter. No menu is shown for Saturday night
when, if a meal is served, it may consist of popular dishes such as
chicken in some form, waffles or steaks, along with such left-overs as
it may be desirable to use.</p>

<p>The menus are intended to serve as a <i>foundation</i> to which may be added
new dishes and seasonable fruits and vegetables, a suggestive list of
which is given elsewhere (see pages <a href="#Page_57">57</a>-<a href="#Page_57">59</a>). From these foundation menus
may be eliminated such dishes as are unpopular or out of season, or
which for any reason it is impractical to serve. Commercial cafeterias
may find it necessary to add other choices to these menus. Very small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
cafeterias may offer fewer choices. The majority of establishments,
however, will find this variety ample, the idea being to serve the
maximum variety within the week rather than within the day or meal.</p>

<p>A star has been used to indicate those dishes in which left-overs may be
used to particular advantage.</p>

<h4>TEA-ROOM MENUS</h4>

<p>The tea-room menu is characterized by daintiness and excellence in food,
garnish and service. Large tea rooms serve a variety such as is found in
large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
hotels, with practically no changes in their menus from day to
day. They are open to the same criticism as are the cafeterias that
serve everything in the market at every meal, and so make their menu
monotonous. Smaller tea rooms offer limited choices,--soups, relishes,
hot dishes, vegetables, salads, breads and beverages. To add choices to
a menu beyond the number which will satisfy the patrons is not economy.
The longer the menu list, the more labor, equipment, food wastage and
spoilage. Therefore the tea-room menu list should be as simple as is
consistent with the demands of those to be served. The menus shown below
are of the type which are changed from day to day. The first is a very
good example of this type, embodying a moderate degree of choice. It is
suitable for a tea room serving perhaps six hundred or more people
daily.</p>

<h4>POPULAR FOOD COMBINATIONS</h4>

<p>Since it is customary to plan the menu, using the meat as a basis, and
since custom and good usage make certain combinations popular, a list of
such combinations is given below with the idea that others may be added
as desired.

<h4>Garnishes</h4>

<p>Clever use of garnishes will do a great deal to make servings
attractive, to develop surprise and stimulate appetite.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>A list of garnishes appropriate to different kinds of food appears
below. Of course there are many others, and the number of different ways
in which ordinary garnishes can be used effectively is surprisingly
large. The alert manager will observe what others in his field are
doing, and will discover many ingenious ideas by reading food journals
and women's magazines.</p>

<p>The garnishes used for soups are practically the same whether for cream
or clear soups.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
  Wafers, cheese and plain<br />
  Croutons<br />
  Olives<br />
  Radishes<br />
  Celery hearts<br />
  Whipped cream (on cream soups)</p></div>

<p>
Some meat garnishes can be used at all times; others are especially
adapted to certain kinds of meat.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hang">  In general<br />

    Watercress, in season<br />

    Clam shells, stuffed with clams and mushrooms<br />
    Mushrooms, sautéd<br />
    Potatoes, cut in fancy shapes, such as shoe strings
      or lattice, and fried in deep fat</p></div>

<p>There are certain garnishes which it is customary to use with salads,
especially with chicken salad.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">  For chicken salad<br />
    Hard-cooked eggs, sliced or cut in eighths<br />
    Lemons, sliced<br />
    Pickles<br />
    Paprika<br />

    Capers<br />
    Olives<br />
    Head lettuce cups</p>

<p class="hang">  For fish salad<br />
    Pickles<br />
    Olives<br />
    Lemons, cut in fancy shapes<br />
    Cucumber baskets holding extra salad dressing<br />
    Paprika<br />
    Parsley</p>

<p class="hang">  For fruit salad<br />
    Tiny cheese balls<br />
    Cheese balls rolled in chopped nuts<br />
    Tiny sandwiches<br />

      <span class="hang">green<br /></span>
      <span class="hang">ripe<br /></span>
      <span class="hang">stuffed<br /></span>
    Cheese straws in fancy shapes</p></div>

of the luncheon meal. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
should be made as appetizing as possible by
the use of suitable garnishes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>  Pickles<br />
  Olives<br />
  Cheese balls<br />
  Parsley<br />
  Watercress<br />
  Attractive paper or plain linen doilies<br />
  Nut meats</p></div>

<p>Desserts by their very nature, require some garnish to make them the
perfect and satisfying last course which they should be. Candied fruit,
marshmallows, slices of fresh orange or strawberries in season, whipped
cream and bright candies add the needed bit of color. Here the use of
paper doilies, glasses and attractively shaped china dishes is a great
factor in appearance.</p>

<p class="smcapc">THE IMPORTANCE AND USE OF FORMS</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Printed forms or other practical aids which may help to reduce menu
planning to a systematic routine are invaluable. Forms such as the party
engagement blanks, shown elsewhere, and the meat order blank and menu
blanks below tend to a desirable standardization. Since meat orders for
the week are usually made out first and the menus planned around the
meats, a form similar to the one shown below, with adaptations for the
particular institution, may be helpful.</p>

<p>The lists of foods and the list of seasonal changes and garnishes
contained in this book will save mental effort and tedium in planning by
suggesting new combinations and variety.</p>

<p>Probably no single device will serve different kinds of institutions,
but the principle of using appropriate printed forms to help in
remembering details holds good for all institutions.</p>

<h4>AN OUTLINE FORM FOR SPECIAL DINNERS</h4>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The efficiency of an organization is judged by the degree of routine
which each phase of the work assumes. In most institutions the serving
of special dinners is quite apart from the ordinary routine of business.
If this service is to be handled simply and efficiently, all of its
various steps must be listed and taken up in an orderly fashion with the
end in view of perfecting an emergency organization as efficient as that
which regulates the daily tasks.</p>

<p>First of all, arrangements made with those who are giving the dinner
should be definite and complete. In order to prevent misunderstandings,
a printed blank such as that shown below (with any adaptations found
necessary) will prove helpful. This may be made out in duplicate, one
copy being retained by the manager and one by those engaging the
services.</p>

<p>Reduced to their simplest form, the steps to be followed in organizing
this work are outlined below.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>RECIPES</h3>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
In the pages that follow are some two hundred recipes for use in
institutions. It will be noted that throughout these recipes, measures
are used rather than weights. This for two main reasons. First, cooks,
except for highly trained professionals, use measures more easily and
with greater success than weights. Second, most institutions cannot
afford an adequate number of accurate scales; and scales that are not
accurate are worse than useless. Measures, on the other hand, are
inexpensive and always available. It may be said that because of the
amounts and the size of the measures used in large quantity cookery
there is not the degree of inaccuracy which is found in measuring small
quantities.</p>

<p>It is hoped the form of the recipes with the spaces for figuring costs
and calories will be of value from the commercial and classroom
standpoint.</p>

<p>Stars indicate those recipes in which left-overs may be used to
particular advantage.</p>

Cut the meat in cubes and soak two thirds of it in the cold water for
about three fourths of an hour. Sear the remainder and add to the meat
which is soaking. Heat the meat, veal bone and water to boiling and let
simmer for four or five hours. Add the seasonings and the vegetables and
cook until the vegetables are soft. Pour the whole through a colander
and cool. When the fat has set, remove and clear by mixing the cold
stock with the shells and slightly beaten whites of eggs. Bring the
mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Let simmer 15 to 20 minutes.
Strain through two or three thicknesses of cheese cloth.</p>

<p>To make the noodles, beat the eggs lightly and add the flour and salt.
This makes a very stiff mixture. Put the mixture on a board and roll as
thin as possible. Sprinkle the dough with flour and roll it into a tight
roll. From this, slice the noodles. Shake out and let dry. Heat the
stock to boiling, add the seasonings and the noodles and cook until
done. Noodles may be made up and kept for some time in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Make a baking-powder biscuit dough. Roll to one third of an inch
thickness, making the dough rectangular in shape. Mix the cinnamon and
sugar and spread over the rolled dough. Sprinkle with the raisins, dot
with the fat and, starting with the longer side, roll up the dough. Cut
off rolls half an inch in thickness and bake in a hot oven. These rolls
may be improved by adding a teaspoon of boiled frosting to the top of
each before serving.</p>

whites last. This makes eighteen two-layer cakes. If preferred, this
amount may be baked in square tins, twenty-four by twenty-four inches,
and will fill three pans. Where a kitchen mixing machine is used in cake
making the best results are obtained by creaming the fat and sugar in
the machine for from twenty to thirty minutes and then adding the
remainder of the ingredients and completing the mixing quickly.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
